#' @title ggh4x extensions to ggplot2
#'
#' @description ggnomics relies on the extension mechanism of ggplot2 through
#'   ggproto class objects, which allows cross-package inheritance of objects
#'   such as geoms, stats, facets, scales and coordinate systems. These objects
#'   can be ignored by users for the purpose of making plots, since interacting
#'   with these objects is preferred through various geom_\*, stat_\*, facet_\*,
#'   coord_\* and scale_\* functions.
